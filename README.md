# Matthew Hocking ePortfolio

This portfolio contains two different artifacts that go over the categories of software engineering, data structures/algorithms, and databases. Each of these artifacts has an associated narrative that goes over how it fits into one or more of these categories. Each narrative can be accessed from the associated project page, narrative directory page, or in the narratives folder of the download. 

Alongside the primary artifacts and narratives are two additional documents. These documents are the project proposal and professional self-assessment. These two documents mark the beginning and end of the course.

The project proposal goes over the initially planned changes for each artifact and identifies the initial goals they aimed to achieve. This file can be found in the narrative directory or the narratives folder of the download.

The professional self-assessment reflects upon the work I completed during this course alongside my work while pursuing my degree as a whole. This can be found on the self-assessment page or a word variant can be found in the assessment directory of the download.
