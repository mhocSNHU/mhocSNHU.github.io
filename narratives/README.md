# Narratives

Each narrative goes over the individual enhancements made in a single week and how they relate to each course goal. Not every course goal was met in a single enchancement, hence not every course goal is touched upon per-narrative. 

Since each week's work was broken up by subject, the narratives are broken up by subject as follows:

Software Engineering - W3 Narrative - Project: Jukebox Application:
